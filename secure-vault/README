A Few Breif Notes...

* Secure-Vault (secv) is a simple password manager for Linux,
written in BASH Shell. That's right, BASH. :) 

* For instruction on how to use secv, just type ./secv
and the help menu will magically appear before your eyes!

* This is Free Software. Please see License. 

* secv uses /home/$USER/secv-map as a dictionary
to associate the name of your vaults with the location
of the encrypted vault on your system's disk. 

* /dev/shm/$USER/ (tmpfs) is used to temporarily 
store the decrypted vault(s). Thus, Un-Encrypted 
Secrets are NEVER written to disk. 

* Contributions/fixes/bug reports are Welcome.

* To prevent gpg2 from using your Desktop Manager dialog 
box for passphrase, you can force a curses menu by:
Install pinentry-curses
echo "pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses" >> ~/.gnupg/pinentry-program
